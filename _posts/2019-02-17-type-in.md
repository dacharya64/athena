This set of projects focuses on using BASIC on different hardware and emulators. For this project, I used the TI-99 home computer, and used the [Classic99](http://www.harmlesslion.com/software/Classic99) emulator.

## Part 1

**Game -- Tone Guessing Game**
One of the games included in the TI-99 manual was a tone-guessing game, which provides a specific pitched tone and has the user try to guess what the tone is by inputting the frequency.

The code for this program was as follows:

```
10 RANDOMIZE
20 INPUT "CHAR CODE?":CODE
30 CALL CLEAR
40 ROW=INT(24*RND)+1
50 COLUMN=INT(32*RND)+1
60 CALL VCHAR(ROW,COLUMN,CODE)
70 GO TO 40
```

The video of this code running is here: https://photos.app.goo.gl/xhjNf7Nj7hmW3qXc9

**Art program -- Mountain Generator**
This program takes an input character and randomly places that character on the screen. The example program in the book demonstrates this with the * character, but for this video I use the ^ character to generate what looks like a series of mountains.

## Part 2

Using the emulator, I retyped each program with a code modification.

**Game -- Guess the Riddle**
On the emulator, I wanted to use the voice module that can be attached to the TI-99. I found that using the emulator in a certain mode enabled it to output speech, with a list of words that can be outputted.

This program asks the user a riddle using text and speech, and has the user guess the answer. If they get it wrong, the program asks the question again.

```
10 CALL CLEAR
20 ANSWER$="CLOCK"
30 PRINT "I have a riddle for you!"
40 PRINT
45 PRINT "What has a hand but cannot type?"
46 PRINT
50 CALL SAY("WHAT HAS A HAND BUT CAN NOT TYPE")
60 INPUT "Do you know the answer? ":GUESS$
70 IF GUESS$=ANSWER$ THEN 110

90 PRINT "Sorry, try again!"
95 PRINT
100 GO TO 30

110 PRINT "You got it!"
120 CALL SAY("GOOD WORK")
```

Here's a video of that in action:

**Art Program -- Landscape Generator**
 I decided to take the randomly placed characters one step further by allowing for more characters to be inputted, and restricting where certain characters could be placed via limiting the rows and columns.

```
10 randomize
20 input "char code 1?":code1
30 call clear
32 input "char code 2?":code2
34 call clear
36 input "char code 3?":code3
38 call clear
40 row1=int(12*rnd)+1
42 row2=int(12*rnd)+12
44 row3=int(12*rnd)+12
50 column1=int(32*rnd)+1
52 column2=int(32*rnd)+1
54 column3=int(32*rnd)+1
60 call vchar(row1,column1,code1)
62 call vchar(row2,column2,code2)
64 call vchar(row3,column3,code3)
70 go to 40
```

Using char codes 42, 94, and 124 outputs a scene that looks like the following, sort of a desert scene with stars effect:

## Part 3
For the last part of the project, I created a pattern generating program and tried to bring it into the analog realm. After talking with [Mirek](http://mirekstolee.com), I decided to make a character generator that I can use to create a map.

The code for the character generator is as follows:

```
5 CALL CLEAR
10 RANDOMIZE
11 CODE1 = 46 //period
12 CODE2 = 43 //+
13 CODE3 = 94 //^
14 CODE4 = 64 //@
20 ROW1=INT(12*RND)+1
30 ROW2=INT(12*RND)+1
40 ROW3=INT(12*RND)+1
45 ROW4=INT(12*RND)+1
50 COL1=INT(32*RND)+1
60 COL2=INT(32*RND)+1
70 COL3=INT(32*RND)+1
75 COL4=INT(32*RND)+1
80 CALL VCHAR(ROW1,COL1,CODE1)
90 CALL VCHAR(ROW2,COL2,CODE2)
100 CALL VCHAR(ROW3,COL3,CODE3)
110 CALL VCHAR(ROW4,COL4,CODE4)
120 GO TO 20
```

With the following keycodes:

```
11 CODE1 = 46 //period
12 CODE2 = 43 //+
13 CODE3 = 94 //^
14 CODE4 = 64 //@
```

Which generates output images for the map:
![](../../../../assets/map1.png)   

![](../../../../assets/map2.png)

![](../../../../assets/map3.png)  

![](../../../../assets/map4.png)  

I then took these images and painted a map inspired by the character layouts:

```
. = road
+ - forest
^ - hill
@ = mountain
```

## Part 4

As a critical postmortem to the project, submit (thorough, thoughtful) written responses to the following questions:

1. Describe the process of typing in the program on actual hardware. What conveniences or inconveniences did you face? What specific constraints or affordances did you encounter? How does it compare to programming on modern platforms? What did you learn about your machine that surprised or interested you?

2. How did emulation change your relationship to programming? Is there anything lost in the transition? What is gained? Did the emulation feel authentic? Why or why not?

3. How did you choose to change your type-in programs? What did you find interesting about modifying a 30-year old program?

4. Is your chosen platform still relevant to computing today? Why or why not? How does this activity tie into our readings this quarter?
